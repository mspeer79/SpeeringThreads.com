-I re-worked the master page to make it more of a "Template" that the other content pages can be "fit" into.

-I took the header logo and image out of the <head> and moved it into the <body> section.  This section is used to include CSS pages. JavaScript files
and other information.  All page content shouldd go in the <body>.

-Moved all of the CSS and <Script> tags from Default.aspx into the Master page so that it can be re-used on each page you create without 
copying/pasting it into each page.
